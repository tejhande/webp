Sure, here's a basic README file you can include with your script:

# Image Converter to WebP Format

This Python script converts images from various formats to WebP format using the Pillow library.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the Pillow library:

```
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Place the images you want to convert in the `input_images` folder.
2. Run the script `image_converter.py`.
3. The converted images will be saved in the `output_images` folder.

## Folder Structure

```
- image_converter.py
- input_images/
  - image1.jpg
  - image2.png
  - ...
- output_images/
```

## Note

- Ensure that the script `image_converter.py` and the `input_images` folder are in the same directory.
- The script will create the `output_images` folder if it does not already exist.
